# Audit Trail for Supply Chains using Blockchain

A secure and scalable platform designed to modernize supply chains through **Blockchain**, **IoT**, and **AI**. This project was built as part of the **Deloitte Capstone Program 2025**.

---

## Overview

Supply chains are vulnerable to fraud, counterfeits, and inefficiencies. Our solution addresses these issues with:

- **Blockchain** (Hyperledger Fabric) for tamper-proof audit trails
- **IoT** sensors for real-time tracking
- **AI/Cloud** (Azure) for analytics and predictions
- **Smart Contracts** to automate compliance and payments

---

## Goals & Objectives

- Increase transparency and trust in supply chains
- Reduce fraud and operational inefficiencies
- Enable compliance without manual effort
- Ensure end-to-end visibility using dashboards and QR verification

---

## Architecture

- Multi-layered architecture with IoT → Blockchain → Smart Contracts → Analytics
- Cloud storage for scalability
- Role-based dashboards for real-time insights

---

## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain:** Hyperledger Fabric
- **IoT:** RFID + Sensors
- **AI/Analytics:** Azure, Python
- **Frontend:** Web & Mobile UI
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity
